# imgEvolving
Desperate attempts to evolve images. Pretty close to working properly.

Only 3 python files are relevant:

-single_creature.py - one-creature take on evolving and base for the rest of the project

-obrazki.py - evolving a population and saving it properly

-animate.py - makes a GIF animation out of saved populations
